# Just Save

Just Save is a simple WebExtension for skipping the "Save As" dialog when saving images, pages and links.

Just Save adds a single item to your context menu that saves the clicked image, link, or page immediately to your default downloads folder, without requiring any additional input.

Currently, Just Saved is available on both [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/just-save/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plaggkdohpgdahkidgjmbhafnbbacpno), with support for other browsers planned.

Just Save is built on top of the WebExtensions API, which means it can work across multiple browsers and will remain compatible with Firefox even after XUL-based addons become deprecated.
