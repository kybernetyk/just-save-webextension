# Just Save

Just Save is a simple WebExtension for skipping the "Save As" dialog when saving images, pages and links.

Just Save adds a single item to your context menu that saves the clicked image, link, or page immediately to your default downloads folder, without requiring any additional input from the user.

Just Save is built on top of the WebExtensions API, which means it works across multiple browsers and will remain compatible with Firefox even after XUL-based addons become deprecated.

Just Save is completely free and open-source. Feel free to visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lewisl9029/just-save-webextension) if you'd like to see the source code, report an issue, or contribute changes.
